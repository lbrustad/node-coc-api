# Clash of Clans API - TypeScript Edition

Okay, I know, there are other APIs that works for NodeJS and web browsers, but I couldn't find any using TS, so I wrote my own one which is fully modular.

## Usage

I written basic test files in the `tests` directory which contains simple-to-understand code in TypeScript, but it's barely any type definitions there, so it looks pretty much like it's pure JavaScript.

## Install

`npm i coc-api` or `npm install coc-api`

## Dependencies

Only `axios`, which is supported by both NodeJS and browsers.
